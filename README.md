# Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I ahave created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I have created in a past assignment. Specifically, I will be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, I have create individual pages for each plot. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
