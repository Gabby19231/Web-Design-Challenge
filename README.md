# Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

## file:///Users/gabriellamartin/Documents/Web-Design-Challenge.html

I have created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I have made in a past assignment. Specifically, I will be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, I have created individual pages for each plot. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.


#### Pages found in this analysis:

- Landing Page
- Visualizations Page
- Comparisons Page
- Data Page
