  <h1>Latitude Vs. X</h1>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">The purpose of this project is to show how weather changes the closer you get to the equator. To start the analysis, I pulled data from OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a data set. After creating the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot aspects of the weather vs. latitude. I looked for included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. The site provided sources of data and visualizations created as a part of the analysis, including explanations regarding trends and correlations.</p>
